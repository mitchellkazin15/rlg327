I kept my same dungeon generator code from the previous project except i added the professors object description class to load objects into the game. I made some pretty large changes to the game starting with the first level of the dungeon being a village with no monsters. Objects still spawn in the village. You spawn on stairs so you can instantly go into the dungeon where the monsters that were loaded from the file reside. I made changes to how the dungeon is displayed. Now you can see one layer into the rocks and they are printed as '#' now. The paths are then printed as '+'. To go up a level from the village you have to go all the way to the top border and find a '<'. Walk through it and you will enter a forest that is populated with monsters and objects. Another change is when you're in Look-Mode and you move over a monster or an object, you can hit SHIFT + I to get its information. NOTE: when you enter a new level, the previous level is saved into HOME/.rlg327/dungeon followed by the number of the dungeonlevel. you may want to delete these files after running.
